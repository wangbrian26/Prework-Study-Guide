          <li>Console.log is a way of putting things into the console, which is like a mini terminal.</li>
          <li>Function is very similar to in python; however, it uses {} instead of :.</li>
          <li>Nearly everything ends in ;</li>
          <li>Alert makes a popup.</li>
          <li>() => indicates an anonymous function. This basically is just saying it is an unnamed function that just executes.</li>
          <li>Var vs. Let vs. Const = Basically variable is the old school useage. It is globally scoped or functionally scoped, depending on where it is defined. The issue with it is that we can change it in teh same scope without running into errors. Let is "block scoped", which means that it only exists within {}. So, if we say let greeter = "Hello" and then in another function {let greeter = "No"}. Then depending where we call, greeter will be "Hello" or "No". If we did this same thing with var, it will always be "No" if it meets the conditions. Const on the other hand cannot be updated or re-declared. Const is also block scoped.</li>
