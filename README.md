# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide was an introductory lesson on the web design workflow. I was able to use this experience to practice the basics of HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript. I have been a teacher for the last 3 years and I currently want to go into educational technologies to build applications that can serve students, teachers, administrators, and parents to further the field of education. This project is mainly for myself to keep track of any tips and ideas I learned while learning how to code and web design.
